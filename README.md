File Metadata
=========================

Simple microservice in JavaScript that displays file sizes in bites when submitted through form data.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BrianLusina/filemetadata
$ cd filemetadata
$ npm install
$ yarn install # if using yarn
$ npm run
```
> that is all you need to get the project up and running on your machine.

This project is very simple and has no UI element to it except being able to submit FormData object that includes a file upload.

In return, a JSON response of the file size will be returned.

That is all!
Enjoy!
